Description: ProcGen
        -------
        
        A procedural content generation system and user interface. The "terrain" module is a modular
        system for generating procedural content such as,
        
        - landscapes
        - rogue-like dungeons
        - doom-like dungeons
        - caves
        - mazes
        
        The system is configured with an XML file that defines what procedural modules are used
        and what their initial parameters are.
        
        The user interface allows you to play around with the parameters and see what the impact
        is of them.
        
        The generation system can be used live in games (using the terrain module and the XML files)
        or you can export the created content to TILED xml files and load them into your
        game in that way.
        
        
        Requires: Python 2.6+, pygame 1.9+
        
        To run the game:
        
            python procgen.py
